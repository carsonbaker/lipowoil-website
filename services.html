        <h2>Crude Oil Marketing</h2>
        <p>The marketing of new crude oil production requires significant effort to maximize its value to refiners reluctant to change operations. This reluctance often translates into lower initial prices for new production. Lipow Oil Associates can qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate new crude production and recommend potential refinery outlets to minimize these additional discounts for trying new crude production.</p>
