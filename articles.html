          This report tries to explain how the oil market works in a simple and brief manner. However the reader should be aware that the oil market is quite complex, no one statement can cover all the cases and instances of oil trading. With crude oil and gasoline prices rising to record levels in 2008 and the potential for new records to be set in the future, it is reasonable to assume that questions arise as to how crude and product prices are ultimately established.

          Tank Storage: Cheery Traders Turn Teary

        <blockquote>
          This  article was written for and published by Tank Storage Magazine. As the crude oil and petroleum product market structure turned from contango to backwardation, traders found themselves with costly tankage weighing down their profitability. With a reluctance to take on as much tankage under lease, the storage operators are seeing rates come under pressure.

          The last 24 months have seen its share of volatility in the crude oil markets. From nearly $150 per barrel two years ago, to almost $50 last July and back up to $80 today, the crude oil market makes the Coney Island Rollercoaster look boring.

          Venezuela Crude Supply to the US

        <blockquote>
          This weekend the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, threatened once again to halt crude oil sales to the United States. It is Lipow Oil Associates opinion that the probability of this event occurring is small but rising. There is no doubt that should this event occur, crude oil prices will go up. However, there is also a downside for Venezuela as well.
